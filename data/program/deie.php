    "project3" =>"Development of a V2X Testbed to Study the Characteristics of Vehicular Networks",
    "project4" =>"Athlete Workload Management System using an IOT Based Wearable Wireless Body Area Network",

    "project1_description" =>"Traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has long been the major transport layer protocol of data transmission over a single network link. Modern applications need higher bandwidth requirements, which must be achieved using multiple simultaneous connections rather than one single link. Multi path TCP (MPTCP) protocol is the perfect candidate for that kind of application. Therefore, this work introduces the development of a MPTCP based router, which gives a higher bandwidth experience to the user by combining the speed of two or more access links. This work has also introduced a novel scheduler algorithm to improve the performance of MPTCP in terms of bandwidth and latency.",
    "project2_description" =>"This is a game designed for people who have had a stroke experience. A stroke occurs when something blocks the blood supply to a part of the brain causing some parts of the brain to become damaged resulting in weakness in one hand or both hands or even death.",
    "project3_description" =>"Recent research focuses on autonomous driving to enhance safety and traffic efficiency. V2X tech is key, but hardware testbeds are scarce. A pioneering testbed offers low latency, minimal resource use, and addresses academic needs for V2X study.",
    "project4_description" =>"Professional athletes aim for peak performance while managing injury and fatigue risks. Our innovative system includes a network of wearable devices with integrated sensors, collecting performance data for analysis, enhancing training, and injury prevention. We aim to democratize high-quality athletic training solutions for wider accessibility.
