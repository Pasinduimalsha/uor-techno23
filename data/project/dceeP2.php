Common problems include cracks due to shrinkage or external factors, like seismic activity, which can weaken structural integrity. Environmental factors, such as freeze-thaw cycles and chemical exposure, can cause deterioration. Inadequate maintenance and improper construction techniques can exacerbate these concerns. Over time, corrosion of embedded steel reinforcements can lead to structural instability. Addressing these problems requires proactive maintenance, proper design, and advanced materials to ensure the longevity and safety of concrete structures
