    "problem_description" => "Advanced nations and elite sports organizations utilize expensive, proprietary sensing technology for athlete workload management, but these solutions are inaccessible to the general public. Mainstream wearable devices and apps, while available, are costly and less accurate. This leaves athletes and trainers in developing countries like Sri Lanka with limited workload management tools, forcing them to rely on traditional methods. Furthermore, existing wearables lack customization and scalability, impeding the development of new performance models due to limited biometric data.",
