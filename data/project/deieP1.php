    "project_description" => "Traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has long been the major transport layer protocol of data transmission over a single network link. Modern applications need higher bandwidth requirements, which must be achieved using multiple simultaneous connections rather than one single link. Multi path TCP (MPTCP) protocol is the perfect candidate for that kind of application. Therefore, this work introduces the development of a MPTCP based router, which gives a higher bandwidth experience to the user by combining the speed of two or more access links. This work has also introduced a novel scheduler algorithm to improve the performance of MPTCP in terms of bandwidth and latency.",

If there is a solution to use all the available network interfaces simultaneously users can enjoy a much better internet experience.",

As per the results obtained final product of our MPTCP protocol based router has effectively enhanced both download and upload data rates, which shows significant improvement of the overall user experience. Furthermore, the through introduction of the 'Redundant at Congestion (RaC)' we could able to fine tune scheduler algorithm by improving MPTCP protocol performance, addressing key metrics of bandwidth and latency. This project demonstrates the potential of MPTCP protocol and benefits of using it",
